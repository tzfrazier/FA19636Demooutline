          <p>You will write an essay evaluating the UNCG Library Website. I expect this writing to be based on your opinions.  It will exceed 250 words. You will take one screenshot, which you will include, in your report. In this essay you will address:
          <ul>
            <li>What are the components of the website?</li>
            <li>	What tasks do you think the website was created to facilitate?</li>
            <li>	Do the components of the site make completing those tasks easy for users? Why?</li>
          </ul></p>
          <p>This evaluative essay will be encoded into an HTML file using proper semantic mark up.<strong><em> For this exercise you will not apply any styling to the html file.</strong></em> You will be using browser defaults. Your assignment will be uploaded as github repository. You will share the link with me. </p>
          <ol>
            Your html file should include the following tags elements, used correctly:
            <li>Title</li>
            <li>Author</li>
            <li>Header</li>
            <li>Ancher</li>
            <li>A list (ordered or unordered)</li>
            <li>Image</li>
            <li>Footer</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Date Completed</li>
                <li>Contact Email</li>
                </ul>

          <p>This assignment serves to provide the instructor with a window in the abilities and tastes of students. By providing a unified text, the instructor has a standard set of data to evaluate writing and analytical ability by. As analysis is an internal process it needs to be explicated in order to be observed. You are being asked evaluate the UNCG Library website using the prompts outlined above, so to gain a snap shot of your knowledge, skills, and abilities at the outset.</p>
          <p> For students this exercise is a further ability to develop taste and begin a practice of analyzing websites for their effectiveness, without having to worry about any gaps between their knowledge of best practice or the theories underlying UX research and design. For those with experience you may find this fustrating, but for those with little experience this is an opertunity to gain some sea legs. You will code the essay as an HTML file as part of familiarizing yourself with the capabilities of that markup language, and the way that a web browser will render that text. In future assignments you will be using css to style and make readable your code. But for now we're learning a bit about how the broswer interprets our code.</p>

        <p>Open a text file and go to the library website. In the text file note the visible parts to the website. Also note who the website seems to be speaking to. Imagine, you are that audience member. Note why you have come to the website in that role. Now write about your ability in that role to use the parts of the site to complete your tasks. Open a word file and create an outline, then fill in the outline using your notes. Proofread your text. Then set up an html file, and copy and paste over the text into the proper tags.</p>
